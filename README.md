# NFA
A nondeterministic finite automaton (NFA), or nondeterministic finite-state machine, does not need to obey these restrictions. In particular every DFA is also an NFA. check out this [link](https://campusingenieriaytecnologia.ull.es/pluginfile.php/344980/mod_assign/introattachment/0/p09_dfa2G.pdf)
## Requisites
An NFA is represented formally by a 5-tuple, {{Σ, Q, q0, F, δ}}, consisting of:
* a finite set of states {\displaystyle Q}Q.
* a finite set of input symbols {\displaystyle \Sigma }\Sigma .
* a transition function {\Delta  : {\displaystyle Q\times \Sigma \rightarrow P(Q)}{\displaystyle Q\times \Sigma \rightarrow P(Q)}.}.
* an initial (or start) state {\displaystyle q_{0}\in Q}q_{0}\in Q.
* a set of states {\displaystyle F}F distinguished as accepting (or final) states {\displaystyle F\subseteq Q}F\subseteq Q.
